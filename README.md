# Feature-Engineering
In this repository, We will be learning about "Feature Engineering". It is part of the machine learning.

**Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from the raw data. Thease feature can be used to                          improve the performance of machine learning algorithm. Here we will be learning, How to make good dataset for the machine learning                          algorithm.

"BAD MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM PERFORMS GOOD ON GOOD DATASET"
                                    
There is four part of the feature engineering:
1. Feature Transformation
2. Feature Construction
3. Feature Selection
4. Feature Extraction

**Feature Transformation:** Feature transformation is mainly responsible for the "Feature Scaling", "Outlier Detection", "Handeling Categorical Feature", and "Missing value imputation".

**Feature Scaling:** It is the step that perform before giving input data to machine learning model. It is last step of the feature engineering. It is a technique to standardise the independent features present in the data in a fixed range. It makes all the dataset column value to one scale.
a.Standardization(Z-score Normalization)
b.Normalization

**Standardization(Z-score Normalization):** 
**Xi=(Xi-Xmean)/standard deviation**

After Standardization:

mean=0 and standard deviation=1
