# Feature-Engineering
In this repository, We will be learning about "Feature Engineering". It is part of the machine learning.

**Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from the raw data. Thease feature can be used to                          improve the performance of machine learning algorithm. Here we will be learning, How to make good dataset for the machine learning                          algorithm.

"BAD MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM PERFORMS GOOD ON GOOD DATASET"
                                    
There is four part of the feature engineering:
1. Feature Transformation
2. Feature Construction
3. Feature Selection
4. Feature Extraction

**Feature Transformation:** Feature transformation is mainly responsible for the "**Feature Scaling**", "**Outlier Detection**", "**Handeling Categorical Feature**", "**Missing value imputation**".
